# ML Project
## Project Description
+ To implement Machine Learning algorithms to estimate sentiment associated with words in a sentence. In this project, Viterbi algorithmn, Max marginal decoding and Viterbi with second order dependencies are used.

## Collaborators
+ Yin Ji Sheng(1001670)
+ Hilda Thian(1001776)
+ Teo Yang Rui(1001518)

## Instructions to run
### Before running:
+ Make sure you have Python 3
+ Make sure the `train`, `dev.out`, and `dev.in` are in the same directory as the `part2_3_4_5.py`

### To run:
1. Simply enter `python part2_3_4_5.py` in your terminal and you should observe new files `modified_train`,`dev.p2.out`, `dev.p3.out`, `dev.p4.out` and `dev.p5.out`
2. You can enter `python evalScript.py dev.out dev.p2.out` to evaluate the F scores of the output files
