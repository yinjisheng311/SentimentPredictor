We O
ate O

for O
dinner O
on O

Imagine O

happy O
surprise O
upon O
finding O
that O
the O
views O
are O
only O
the O
third-best O
thing O
about O
Ray's O
! O

The O
bread O
was O
stale O
, O
the O
salad B-positive
was O
overpriced O
and O
empty O
. O

They O
have O
a O
huge O
selection O
of O
different O
cream O
cheeses O
and O
all O
of O
their O
salads B-positive
are O
great O

A O

delight O

I O
was O
so O
stunned O
, O
and O
I O
left O
the O
dinner O
hungry O
and O
majorly O
disappointing O

the O

We O

around O

in O
the O

I O

the O

My O

I O
are O
avid O

and O
we O
are O
always O
on O
the O

our O

recommended O
Flatbush O

, O
you O
need O
to O
get O
in O
here O
! O

I O
heartily O
recommend O
. O

I O
thought O
this O
place O
was O
totally O
overrated O
. O

The O
sandwiches O
are O
dry O
, O
tasteless O
and O
way O
overpriced O
. O

The B-neutral
pizza I-neutral

are O
light O
and O
scrumptious O

I O
had O
a O
taste O
of O
all O

on O

plate O
, O
and O
they O
were O
superb O

The O

was O
huge O

awesome O

If O
you're O

large O

this O

I O
will O
never O

I O
will O
give O
them O
another O
chance O
and O
make O
sure O
to O
tell O
them O
to O
kick O
it O
up O
several O
notches O
. O

It O
looked O
like O
shredded O
cheese O
partly O
done O
- O
still O
in O
strips O

Go O
there O
once O
and O
oh O
yes O
... O
you O
will O
go O
back O
... O
you O
will O

This O
place O
, O
which O
is O
only O
a O
few O
months O
old O
, O
is O
perhaps O
Queens O
' O
biggest O
secret O
! O

we O
ordered O
the O
honey B-positive
walnut I-positive
prawns I-positive
which O
we O
always O
order O
at O
every O
chinese O
restaurant O
to O
determine O
the O

Wow O
. O

This O
place O
blew O
me O
away O
... O
by O
far O
my O
new O
favorite O
restaurant O
on O
the O
uppereast O
side O
. O

On O
my O
meal B-positive
I O
had O
to O
send O
back O
my O
eggs O
for O
a O
simple O
request O
of O
breaking O
the O
yokes O
before O
cooking O
, O
and O
would O
have O
had O
to O
send O
them O
back O
again O
if O
I O
hadn't O
rejected O
the O
meal B-positive
all O
together O
. O

Rao O
is O
a O
good O
restaurant O
, O
but O
it's O
nothing O
special O
. O

Cozy O
romantic O
atomosphere O
with O
only O
around O
15 O
tables O
at O
most O
. O

My O
friend O
got O
the O
mushroom B-positive
pizza I-positive
which O
tasted O
better O
. O

Always O
great O
service B-positive

Maybe O
tomorrow O
;-) O

If O
celebrities O
make O
you O
sweat O
, O
then O
your O
in O
for O
a O
ride O
, O
but O
if O
your O
like O
most O
around O
these O
parts O
then O
you'll O
just O
yawn O
and O
wonder O
whats O
with O
all O
the O
hype O
. O

Its O
location O
is O
good O
and O
the O
fact O
that O
Hutner O
College O
is O
near O
and O
their O
prices O
are O
very O
reasonable O
, O
makes O
students O
go O
back O
to O
Suan B-positive
again O
and O
again O
. O

This O
is O
a O
fun O
restaurant O
to O
go O
to O
. O

Favorite O
Sushi B-positive
in O
NYC O

Great O
food B-positive
! O

We O
ate O
outside O
at O
Haru's O
Sake O
bar O
because O
Haru's O
restaurant O
next O
door O
was O
overflowing O
. O

Highly O
recommended O
. O

Excellent O
sashimi O
, O
and O
the O
millennium B-positive
roll I-positive
is O
beyond O
delicious O
. O

The O
service B-positive
was O
excellent O
- O
friendly O
and O
attentive O
. O

Great O
sushi O
experience O
. O

The O
cooks O
have O
been O
at O
the O
restaurant O
for O
years O
and O
cook O
family O
recipes O
. O

Before O
the O
steak O
came O
, O
the O
server B-positive
told O
us O
that O
the O
steak O
did O
not O
come O
with O
any O
sides O
and O
suggested O
I O
pick O
something O
from O
the O
menu O
. O

Was O
surprisingly O
disappointed O
. O

The O
sommelier O
is O
fantastic O
, O
down-to-earth O
, O
& O
extremely O
knowlegable O
. O

The O
pancakes B-positive
should O
be O
larger O
( O
at O
least O
8 O
" O
) O
to O
justify O
the O
expense O
even O
with O
the O
unique O
offerings O
. O

Well O
... O
they O
can O
run O
but O
they O
can't O
hide O
. O

Fresh O

mind O
blowing O

Ray's O
is O
something O
of O
a O
Seattle O
institution O
, O
but O
given O
its O
gorgeous O
Sound O
views O
, O
I O
had O
suspected O
that O
the O
accolades O
were O
more O
due O
to O
the O
scenery O
than O
to O
the O
food B-positive
and O
service B-positive
. O

Everyone O
that O
sat O
in O
the O
back O
outside O
agreed O
that O
it O
was O
the O
worst O
service B-positive
we O
had O
ever O
received O
. O

Need O
I O
say O
more O
? O

If O
I O
want O
to O
stand O
in O
line O
on O
Sunday O
for O
an O
hour O
to O
get O
average O
brunch O
food B-positive
, O
then O
I O
would O
put O
Murphy's O
at O
the O
top O
of O
the O
list O
. O

The O
brioche O
and O
lollies O
as O
party O
favors O
is O
a O
cute O
and O
sweet O
touch O
to O
a O
most O
memorable O
meal B-positive
. O

Chennai O
Garden O
is O
my O
favorite O
Indian O
restaurant O
in O
the O
city O
. O

I O
went O
with O
JWILS O
. O

My O
GF O
and O
I O
dine O
at O
Bukhara B-positive
often O
as O
she O
lives O
near O
it O
. O

At O
first O
we O
were O
a O
little O
taken O
aback O
, O
as O
this O
seemed O
to O
present O
a O
problem O
, O
although O
the O
restaurant O
looked O
fairly O
empty O
, O
but O
they O
hastily O
put O
the O
table O
together O
for O
us O
. O

DO O
not O
try O
unless O
you're O
just O
going O
there O
to O
hang O
out O
like O
the O
rest O
of O
the O
hipsters O
who O
apparently O
have O
no O
sense O
of O
taste O
. O

It O
is O
very O
overpriced O
and O
not O
very O
tasty O
. O

I O
had O
a O
great O
experience O
. O

whoever O
the O
jazz O
duo O
was O
, O
they O
were O
on O
POINT O
. O

The O
decor B-positive
in O
this O
place O
is O
very O
diner-ish O
and O
the O
kind O
of O
place O
you O
expect O
in O
the O
East O
Village O
- O
not O
romantic O
, O
just O
simple O
, O
small O
and O
sparse O
. O

We O
used O
to O
frequent O
most O
of O
their O
restaurants O
but O
over O
the O
years O
each O
one O
has O
really O
been O
disapointing O
. O

All O
the O
people O
that O
I O
bring O
there O
go O
back O
on O
their O
own O
and O
bring O
THEIR O
friends O
! O

The O
waitress B-negative
, O
seems O
to O
be O
more O
concerned O
of O
looking O
good O
than O
actually O
waitressing O
. O

oh O
speaking O
of O
bathroom O
, O
the O
mens O
bathroom O
was O
disgusting O
. O

As O
of O
writing O
this O
I O
just O
tried O
their O
give O
away O
a O
link O
again O
& O
it O
still O
doesn't O
work O
. O

The O
best O
pad B-positive
thai O
i've O
ever O
had O
. O

I O
will O
be O
out O
with O
friends O
and O
all O
of O
a O
sudden O
I O
am O
hungry O
and O
I O
only O
crave O
one O
thing O
... O
their O
Pizza B-positive
. O

Also O
, O
they O
do O
not O
take O
credit O
card O
so O
come O
with O
cash O
! O

The O
decor B-positive
is O
night O
tho O
... O
but O
they O
REALLY O
need O
to O
clean O
that O
vent O
in O
the O
ceiling O
... O
its O
quite O
un-appetizing O
, O
and O
kills O
your O
effort O
to O
make O
this O
place O
look O
sleek O
and O
modern B-positive
. O

I O
don't O
know O
why O
anyone O
would O
want O
to O
write O
a O
great O
review O
about O
this O
place O
. O

By O
the O
time O
we O
left O
our O
wallets O
were O
empy O
and O
so O
were O
our O
stomachs O
AND O
we O
missed O
the O
show O
we O
were O
supposed O
to O
see O
following O
our O
dinner O
, O
which O
would O
have O
been O
acceptable O
if O
we O
got O
to O
enjoy O
the O
experience O
of O

Are O
you O

Cal O
, O
this O
one O
is O
not O
worth O
the O
wait O
or O
any O
extra O
effort O
to O
visit O
. O

She O
promised O
to O
speak O
to O
the O
waitress B-negative
who O
had O
flown O
off O
in O
a O
rage O
, O
but O
we O
could O
hardly O
take O
her O
promise O
seriously O
, O
seeing O
as O
she O
hadn't O
bothered O
to O
get O
the O
waitresses O
name O
. O

The O
atmosphere B-positive
is O
nothing O
special O
, O
but O
it O
feels O
like O
a O
Sushi B-positive
establishment O
in O
Tokyo O
. O

Once O
you're O
inside O

the O
real O
experience O
begins O

When O
I'm O

head O
for O

The O
only O
fallback O
on O
this O
restaurant O
is O
the O
prices O

Caution O
- O
its O
real O
food B-positive
for O
people O
who O
love O
the O

The O
prices O
are O
wonderfully O
low O

Good O

The O

the O
most O
talkative O
, O
but O
everytime O
I've O
been O
there O
they O
have O
been O
very O
busy O

which O
probably O
accounts O
for O
the O
lack O

The O
food B-positive

going O

I O
haven't O
been O
to O
the O

The O
price O

Try O

for O

as O
the O
smoked O

was O
incredible O
and O
the O

Never O

an O
explanation O

had O

the O
BEST O
was O
the O
lobster B-positive

We O

over O
