very O
#UNK# O

#UNK# O
was O
the O
last O
night O
in O
#UNK# O
and O
was O
too O
late O
and O
most O
of O
the O
restaurant O
were O
#UNK# O
- O
so O
we O
walked O
in O
the O
check O
the O
place O
. O

The O
people B-positive
that O
work O
there O
are O
always O
so O
friendly O
you O
forget O
you O
are O
in O
New O
York O
sometimes O
. O

#UNK# O
#UNK# B-positive
and O
super O
tasty O
. O

I O
found O
it O
on O
a O
cold O
night O
, O
the O
perfect O
spot B-positive
to O
warm O
up O
. O

Maybe O
it O
is O
good O
for O
that O
one O
night O
once O
in O
a O
#UNK# O
#UNK# O
when O
the O
#UNK# O
decide O
to O
use O
fish B-negative
that's O
#UNK# O
decent O
. O

I O
come O
from O
a O
family O
of O
#UNK# O
owners O
, O
and O
I'm O
almost O
#UNK# O
to O
say O
that O
the O
pizza B-positive
in O
#UNK# O
#UNK# O
my O
#UNK# O
#UNK# O
away O
. O

The O
#UNK# B-negative
are O
#UNK# O
if O
you O
are O
sitting O
#UNK# O
the O
#UNK# O
on O
#UNK# O
#UNK# O
. O

I O
highly O
recommend O
the O
restaurant B-positive
#UNK# O
on O
our O
experience O
last O
night O
. O

My O
only O
#UNK# O
comment O
is O
that O
I O
wish O
the O
pieces B-negative
were O
a O
little O
bigger O
. O

I O
may O
not O
be O
a O
sushi O
#UNK# O
but O
I O
can O
tell O
you O
that O
the O
food B-negative
here O
is O
just O
okay O
and O
that O
there O
is O
not O
much O
else O
to O
it O
. O

#UNK# B-positive
was O
good O
... O
but O
I O
have O
to O
say O
that O
I O
found O
everything O
a O
bit O
overpriced O
. O

A O
#UNK# B-negative
, O
maybe O
the O
manager O
, O
came O
to O
our O
table O
, O
and O
without O
so O
much O
as O
a O
smile O
or O
#UNK# O
asked O
for O
our O
order O
. O

I O
like O
Cafe B-positive
#UNK# I-positive
dont O
get O
me O
wrong O
, O
it O
is O
#UNK# O
that O
the O
people B-negative
who O
work O
there O
are O
#UNK# O
and O
#UNK# O
! O
! O

#UNK# O
the O
#UNK# O
of O
an O
attentive O
waiter B-positive
. O

They O
were O
very O
#UNK# O
with O
me O
when O
I O
called O
and O
actually O
#UNK# O
the O
food O
was O
late O
because O
they O
were O
out O
of O
rice O
. O

The O
chicken B-positive
#UNK# I-positive
and O
chicken B-positive
#UNK# I-positive
#UNK# I-positive
are O
my O

meat O
dishes O
. O

The O
have O
over O
100 O
different O
#UNK# B-positive
to O
offer O
#UNK# O
#UNK# O
so O
that O
made O
my O
husband O
very O
happy O
and O
the O
food B-positive
was O
delicious O
, O
if O
I O
must O
recommend O
a O
dish O
it O
must O
be O
the O
#UNK# B-positive
#UNK# I-positive
. O

I O
wasn't O
#UNK# O
to O
have O
to O
wait O
on O
line O
for O
#UNK# O
minutes O
, O
but O
I O
guess O
that's O
the O
price O
you O
pay O
for O
a O
popular O

even O
more O
