Food I-neutral
wise B-positive
, I-neutral
its O
ok O

a O
bit O
pricey B-positive
for O
what O
you O
get O
considering O
the O
restaurant B-positive
isn't O
a O
fancy O
place O
. O
 
– O
tucked B-positive
away O
over O

the O
Beverly B-positive

My O
mouth O

in O
my O
throat B-positive
after O
I B-negative
left O
the O

The B-neutral
